# Management System

### Packages

* config - contains configuration classes for Spring Boot application
* controllers - controller classes, which handle incoming HTTP requests and return responses
* domain (model) - holds the core domain objects of application, representing the main business entities and logic
    * dto - simple objects used to transfer data between different parts of the application, especially between the
      client and server
    * entities - the JPA entities that map to database tables. They are annotated with @Entity and typically contain
      fields, getters/setters, and possibly relationships between other entities (e.g., @OneToMany, @ManyToOne)
* mappers - responsible for mapping data between different layers of the application
* repositories - contains repository interfaces that extend Spring Data JPA repositories. These interfaces are used to
  perform CRUD operations on entities
* services - includes service classes, which contain the business logic of application. Service classes interact with
  repositories to fetch, process, and save data.
